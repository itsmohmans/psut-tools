# Study Plan Enhancer

A simple script to add some styling and functionalities to PSUT's study plan page.

## Current Features

- Different colors for passed, registered, and remaining courses
- Checkboxes to select courses, highlighted with a different color (useful while registering for a new semester)
- A floating box that keeps track of credits hours registered, passed, and user selected courses

## How to use

The easiest way to run this script is to install a user script browser extension like [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) (recommended) or [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php?browser=chrome).
After installing any of these extensions, you can add [`main.user.js`](https://github.com/itsmohmans/psut-tools/blob/main/studyplan-enhancer/main.user.js) as a user script.
In Violentmonkey for example:

1. go to extension settings
2. click on the `+` icon on the top left
3. from here, you can either select `New` and copy my script and paste it directly in the extension, or
4. select `Install from URL` and paste this Github raw url <https://github.com/itsmohmans/psut-tools/raw/main/studyplan-enhancer/main.user.js>
